# VPS Setup Tutorial Files

These are the template files that are used in the tutorial series,
[VPS Setup Tutorial](https://timofejew.com/series/). They can be
used as is, but I'd recommend reading the series first.

In order to use these files, you'll have to replace `example.com`
and `example.ca` with your own domains. That, and a few of them
need specific ownership and file modes as described in the tutorial.
